# Week 5 - Work Day Scheduler

This week's task involved creating a simple work day planner to help organize your schedule. This consisted of a table listing the hours from 9-5, a textarea for user input, and a save button to grab the input from the textarea and save it to local storage - to then be displayed in the appropriate timeslot.

The rows of the table had to have relevant colouring correlating to whether the timeslot was in the past, present, or future in realtime. This was achieved using moment.js which we learnt about in week 5. This is also how I created the live clock in the header.

This week's challenge was a great exercise in DOM manipulation using jQuery and also utilised boostrap, to the degree that the index.html file was barely touched and I found it to be quite practical and useful.
